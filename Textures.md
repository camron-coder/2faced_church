Immersion and theme - My theme for the map was a church that had another face to it. I wanted it to have a cultish other side that you can see through the blownup wall. That's why i chose textuers that seemed to have nothing to do with each other but that bothed seemed relgious/cultish. I wanted the player to seem like they were stepping into 2 different maps when playing ![2faced_chruch_2024-10-24_13-20-58](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3be1a6e3-54a3-4bb8-99d5-d20e3e71e353)![2faced_chruch_2024-10-24_13-35-42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57285ec3-4c76-4297-9dca-65d21ea61793)
I also wanted the cult side of the church to seem like it was made out of people which is why i gave the walls the fleshy textuers. For the other side i didn't want to go for the traditonal christian church, so i made an ancient looking church. 

Guidance and orientation - The main fighting area is the middle section where the wall is blown up thats why i have the torches leading  up to it.![2faced_chruch_2024-10-24_13-40-34](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed36df2d-d807-4466-9b03-2b91be96680a)![2faced_chruch_2024-10-24_13-40-08](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4653abdc-7316-489a-890a-569b7a89784e)
I wanted the entrance to the doorways more promenet so that players would be more enticed to enter. While the player can go outside they i would prefer if they fought inside because thats where i put the most weapons.
