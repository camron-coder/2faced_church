# Immersion and theme
I wanted the lights to look like that of an ancient church that also had a dark side to it. I want the player to not only feel excited but also a bit scared to be there.  ![2faced_chruch_2024-10-24_13-54-42](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/53589065-ac68-42ea-abfe-502ae6b41f58)

I made the torch holders to look different for both sides so that they may can hvae 2 differnt vibes to them. I wish i was able to change the color of the torches so that they can truly give off 2 different feelings but im still happy with the outcome.


# Guidance and orientation 
My thinking for the lights was to make it like a movie theater with the lights on the floor used to help guide people to there seats. I wanted my lights to guide players through the entrance to big killing area.

As stated previously the middle area is supposed to be like a main fighting stage, thats why i have the torches on both sides to lead straight to it .
